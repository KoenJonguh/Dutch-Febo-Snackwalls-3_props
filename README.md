<b>Dutch Febo Snackwalls with 3 extra props for your eating animations.</b>


Just drag and drop everything into your resources and add them to your server.cfg
It'll be better to add the 3 props to your own general prop folder if you have one. If so, don't forget to add this to your fxmanifest:

<i>data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'stream/knjgh_dutch_snacks.ytyp'</i>

Febo Snack Wall locations (These are the coords i used for the esx_shops markers):
</br>
-1791.7887, -1199.5624, 13.0178
</br>
-3033.7012, 580.3052, 7.8022
</br>
1702.6693, 4937.6641, 42.0781

You can ofcourse add more locations or change them by editing the ymap.
